# üåü About Me:
Hi there, my name is Aliia<br>A bit of C++, a bit of Java, but that was 5 years ago. Now I'm a medical physicist who is trying my hand at QA testing<br><br>I have a Master's degree in Medical Physics and have worked in Radiology for over a year in my profession. Since moving to Thailand, I had to forget about being a physicist and try my hand at being a QA engineer. Unfortunately, I'm still a QA engineer with only a certificate in hand and almost zero commercial experience. All I can still boast of as a specialist are the test cases and checklists that I created during my training
